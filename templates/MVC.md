Model-View-Controller, or MVC for short, has become one of the most popular web application coding templates in recent years. Three-layer programming.

The idea behind the MVC architectural model is very simple and can be expressed in the following ways:

Model: The model is responsible for managing the Business Logic application. In general, Business Logic means that the application we are considering is designed to be the most important part of the software.

View: The view of the application is where various data are exposed to the users of the application. For example, this page of the academy rudder you see is part of the rudder web application of the academy.

Controller: The controller, as its name implies, is responsible for control. In other words, the controller takes users' requests and checks to see which part of the application is responsible for responding to these requests.
