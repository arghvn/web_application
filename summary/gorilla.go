// Letâ€™s install our routing library:

// go get github.com/gorilla/mux
// This will add the gorilla/mux library to your project.

// Now, we can modify our code to make use of the functionality that this library provides :

package main

import (
	// Import the gorilla/mux library we just installed
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func main() {
	// Declare a new router
	r := mux.NewRouter()

	// This is where the router is useful, it allows us to declare methods that
	// this path will be valid for
	r.HandleFunc("/hello", handler).Methods("GET")

	// We can then pass our router (after declaring all our routes) to this method
	// (where previously, we were leaving the second argument as nil)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World!")
}
