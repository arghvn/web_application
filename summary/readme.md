This application will require three components :
1.	The web server
2.	The front-end (client side) app
3.	The database

Creating your project directory
 
The first thing  is create a new directory for our project. For this , we’ll call it birdpedia 
All the files and commands executed henceforth will be within this directory.
Let’s initialize a new module for our project. This will help us install and maintain dependencies that we’ll need to run our application.
(go mod init github.com/sohamkamani/birdpedia)
Here, I’m initializing a new module with the repository I intend the module to reside in. You should change the module name based on your repository location This should create the go.mod and go.sum files within your folder.
