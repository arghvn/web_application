// Testing is an essential part of making any application “production quality”.
// It ensures that our application works the way that we expect it to.

// Lets start by testing our handler. Create a file called main_test.go:

// main_test.go

package main

// returns it to us. We can now use this function
// to instantiate and test the router outside of the main function

	r := mux.NewRouter()

	return r

	// that we defined above. The rest of the code stays the same

}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World!")

func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
	//Here, we form a new HTTP request. This is the request that's going to be
	// passed to our handler.
	// The first argument is the method, the second argument is the route (which
	//we leave blank for now, and will get back to soon), and the third is the
	//request body, which we don't have in this case.
	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "", nil)

	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)

	// We use Go's httptest library to create an http recorder. This recorder
	// will act as the target of our http request
	// (you can think of it as a mini-browser, which will accept the result of
	// the http request that we make)
	recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()

	// Create an HTTP handler from our handler function. "handler" is the handler
	// function defined in our main.go file that we want to test
	hf := http.HandlerFunc(handler)

// Go uses a convention to ascertains a test file when it has the pattern *_test.go

// To run this test, just run :

// go test ./...
// from your project root directory. You should see a message telling you that everything ran ok.

// Making our routing testable
// If you notice in our previous snippet, we left the “route” blank while creating our mock request using http.newRequest.
// How does this test still pass if the handler is defined only for “GET /handler” route?

// Well, turns out that this test was only testing our handler and not the routing to our handler.
//  In simpler terms, this means that the above test ensures that the request coming in will get served correctly provided that
//  it’s delivered to the correct handler.

// In this section, we will test this routing, so that we can be sure that each handler is mapped to the correct HTTP route.

// Before we go on to test our routing, it’s necessary to make sure that our code can be tested for this. Modify the main.go file.

func TestRouter(t *testing.T) {
	// Instantiate the router using the constructor function that
	// we defined previously

// Now we know that every time we hit the GET /hello route, we get a response of hello world.
// If we hit any other route, it should respond with a 404. In fact, let’s write a test for precisely this requirement :

func TestRouterForNonExistentRoute(t *testing.T) {
	r := newRouter()
	mockServer := httptest.NewServer(r)
	// Most of the code is similar. The only difference is that now we make a
	//request to a route we know we didn't define, like the `POST /hello` route.
	resp, err := http.Post(mockServer.URL+"/hello", "", nil)

	// We want our status to be 405 (method not allowed)
	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusMethodNotAllowed {

// Serving static files
// “Static files” are the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and the other static asset files that are needed to form a website.

// There are 3 steps we need to take in order to make our server serve these static assets.

// Create static assets
// Modify our router to serve static assets
// Add tests to verify that our new server can serve static files

// Create static assets
// To create static assets, create a directory in your project root directory, and name it assets :

// mkdir assets
// Next, create an HTML file inside this directory. This is the file we are going to serve, along with any other file that goes inside the assets directory :

// touch assets/index.html
// Modify the router
// Interestingly enough, the entire file server can be enabled in just adding 3 lines of code in the router. The new router constructor will look like this :

func newRouter() *mux.Router {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.HandleFunc("/hello", handler).Methods("GET")

	// Declare the static file directory and point it to the
	// directory we just made
	staticFileDirectory := http.Dir("./assets/")
	// Declare the handler, that routes requests to their respective filename.
	// The fileserver is wrapped in the `stripPrefix` method, because we want to
	// remove the "/assets/" prefix when looking for files.
	// For example, if we type "/assets/index.html" in our browser, the file server
	// will look for only "index.html" inside the directory declared above.
	// If we did not strip the prefix, the file server would look for
	// "./assets/assets/index.html", and yield an error
	staticFileHandler := http.StripPrefix("/assets/", http.FileServer(staticFileDirectory))
	// The "PathPrefix" method acts as a matcher, and matches all routes starting
	// with "/assets/", instead of the absolute route itself
	r.PathPrefix("/assets/").Handler(staticFileHandler).Methods("GET")
	return r
}

// Testing the static file server

func TestStaticFileServer(t *testing.T) {
	r := newRouter()
	mockServer := httptest.NewServer(r)

	// We want to hit the `GET /assets/` route to get the index.html file response
	resp, err := http.Get(mockServer.URL + "/assets/")
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	// We want our status to be 200 (ok)
	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		t.Errorf("Status should be 200, got %d", resp.StatusCode)
	}

	// It isn't wise to test the entire content of the HTML file.
	// Instead, we test that the content-type header is "text/html; charset=utf-8"
	// so that we know that an html file has been served
	contentType := resp.Header.Get("Content-Type")
	expectedContentType := "text/html; charset=utf-8"

	if expectedContentType != contentType {
		t.Errorf("Wrong content type, expected %s, got %s", expectedContentType, contentType)
	}

}

// To actually test your work, run the server :

// go run main.go
// And navigate to http://localhost:8080/assets/ in your browser.

// Making a simple browser app :
// Since we need to create our bird encyclopedia, lets create a simple HTML document that displays the list of birds,
// and fetches the list from an API on page load, and also provides a form to update the list of birds
