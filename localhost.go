// Creating a web server with Golang :
// Go has HTTP package that contains utilities for quickly creating a web or file server.

// The goal of this project is to create a web server that can accept a GET request and serve a response.
// We’ll use the server to serve static files, acting as a file server.
// We’ll then make the web server respond to a POST request coming from a form submission, such as a contact form.

// refer to webserver repository
